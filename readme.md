# Microswitch PCB

As part of the Smallpeice summer school, students create sensors to mount on their robots. Previously, this has been done using breadboards and veroboard. This suffered from issues with fitting the microswitch pins into the breadboards and mounting the board to the robot.

As such, this PCB is designed to be a simple breakout board for a microswitch. It has footprints for a microswitch, debouncing circuitry and a 3-pin screw terminal to connect to the board. The board is designed to be mounted on 2020 aluminium extrusion chassis with M5 screws.
